### Bike Share project - bikeshare.py with readme.txt

### This python program was built to share data from the first 6 months of 2016 bikeshare data from three cities, New York City, Washington D.C., and Chicago.  It was to allow the user to peruse the different sets of data to include start and stop hubs, biker gender info, times of rides from source location to destination location, and a few other sets of info.  It was also to allow the user to select what city's info they want to view to include all if selected, the month(s) they want to view to include all if selected, and the day(s) they want to view to include all if selected.  It was then to allow the user to display more data in each category if desired as well as allow the user to start over and view another city or cities together if desired.
